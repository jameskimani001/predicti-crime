## Deployment
Deploying on Netlify
To deploy your website on Netlify, follow these steps:

1. Sign Up/Login to Netlify
Go to Netlify and create an account or log in using your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account.

2. Prepare Your Website
Make sure your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are ready. If you're using a build tool or framework (like React or Next.js), run the build process to generate production-ready files.

3. Connect Your Git Repository (Optional)
In the Netlify dashboard, click "New Site from Git", choose your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), and select your repository.

4. Configure Build Settings
For most static websites, Netlify automatically detects the build settings. If needed, specify the build command (e.g., npm run build) and the directory to publish (e.g., build or dist).

5. Deploy Your Site
Click "Deploy Site", and Netlify will start the deployment process. Once finished, you'll receive a live URL like https://your-site-name.netlify.app.

6. Add a Custom Domain (Optional)
If you have a custom domain, you can add it in Site Settings > Domain Management and update your DNS records accordingly.

Your website is now live on Netlify!

## Future Enhancements

- **SMS Notifications**: Send SMS alerts to users and law enforcement
- **Evidence Upload**: Allow uploading of photos and videos as evidence
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Implement machine learning for crime prediction
- **Multi-language Support**: Add Swahili and other local language options
- **Emergency Response**: Integration with emergency services
- **Community Watch**: Neighborhood alert system
- **Cloud Database Integration**: Move from localStorage to a persistent cloud database
